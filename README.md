# GIS Portfolio
Welcome to my GIS portfolio! Below you can browse examples of my GIS coursework and personal cartography projects. 


## About me 
<img align="left" width="25%" height="25%" src="assets/images/about-me.jpeg">
My name is Ashton Gibson and Iâ€™m an undergraduate student in the Program in the Environment at the University of Michigan. 
<br />
<br />
I am particularly interested in the field of GIS for the applications in environmental conservation, as well as the opportunites for facilitating scientific communication through mapping.
<br />
<br />
Through my coursework, I have become familiar with GIS skills such as:

- Creating and editing geospatial data
- Building workflow models to aid in analyses
- Performing spatial, interpolation, and geoprocessing analyses
- Using Hydrologic modeling toolsets in ArcGIS to conduct watershed analyses
- Working with digital elevation models
- Using/building 3D models and 3D Local Scenes in ArcGIS
- Creating interactive maps or uploading existing maps via ArcGIS Online
<br />

### Coursework Layouts
The layouts below are examples from my work in _Earth 408: Intro to GIS for Earth Science_. These projects were assigned and sourced from the textbook _Discovering GIS and ArcGIS Pro_ (Third Edition) by Bradley Shellito. 
<br />
<br />
#### #1- Suitability Analysis: 
<img align="left" width="50%" height="50%" src="assets/images/suitability_analysis.jpg">
<br />
In this assignment I employed ArcGIS Model Builder and Python script to analyze and edit multiple raster datasets at once using various raster calculations, ultimately outputting a dataset that displayed areas with the correct limiting criteria. 
<br /> 
<br />

#### #2- Watershed Analysis: 
<img align="left" width="45%" height="50%" src="assets/images/watershed.jpg">
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here I used a digital elevation model to calculate the watershed boundary, flow direction, and  stream order of the study area, using ArcGIS Hydrologic Modeling tools.
<br />

#### #3- Cost Path Analysis: 
<img align="right" width="65%" height="50%" src="assets/images/cost_path.jpg">
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This project shows the local 3D scene of a shaded relief of terrain. I calculated distance over a digital elevation model, and learned how the "cost" of a path is calculated and changed given different input parameters.

My **final project** for this course was a case study of Harmful Algal Bloom formation in a local lake, in which I conducted a watershed analysis via ArcGIS. My research poster can be viewed <a href="./assets/final_proj/final.pdf">here</a>.

### QGIS Layouts
These layouts are projects I've done for fun, to practice using QGIS and my cartographic design skills.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
These layouts are an ongoing project of mine to display the bathymetry of all the Great Lakes. Here I was testing out two similar color ramps and display styles.

This is another stylized example, this displayes the elevation of Mumbai.

I love my current work-study job at UMS, so to practice, I digitized all of our venues and offices and made a simple map of the area!
