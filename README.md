# GIS Portfolio
Welcome to my GIS portfolio! Below you can browse examples of my GIS coursework and personal cartography projects. 


## About me 
<img align="left" width="25%" height="25%" src="assets/images/about-me.jpeg">
My name is Ashton Gibson and Iâ€™m an undergraduate student in the Program in the Environment at the University of Michigan. 
<br />
<br />
I am particularly interested in the field of GIS for the applications in environmental conservation, as well as the opportunites for facilitating scientific communication through mapping.
<br />
<br />
Through my coursework and internship experience, I have become familiar with GIS skills such as:

- Creating and editing geospatial data
- Building workflow models to aid in analyses
- Performing spatial, interpolation, and geoprocessing analyses
- Using Hydrologic modeling toolsets in ArcGIS to conduct watershed analyses
- Creating interactive maps or uploading existing maps via ArcGIS Online
<br />

## Coursework Layouts
The first layout is an sample of coursework I completed in _Environ 531: GIS Principles_. 
<br />

### #1- Vector Spatial Overlay Analysis: 
This course emphasized real-world applications of GIS, and the goal of this assignment was to display multiple types of spatial information in a way which is still digestible to a general audience. 
<br /> <br />
<br /><br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
<br />

The following layouts are projects I completed in _Earth 309: GIS Explorations_. 
<br />

### #2- Suitability Analysis (Vector): 
<br />
This assignment used stacked data queries to identify regions of interest, as well as spatial overlay tools to combine the various data sources. I also utilized Esri data enrichment to calculate spatial statistics for the region.
<br /> <br />
<br /><br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />

<br />

### #3- Earthquake Risk Assessment: 

<img align="left" width="65%" height="50%" src="assets/images/Liquefaction-Risk-Layout.jpg">


These two layouts are from my semester project, where I aimed to assess earthquake risk along the San Andreas fault by combining geologic and demographic factors. I used raster calculations and spatial overlay tools to combine the data and visually assess the regions with the highest risk.
<br />

<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br />

The layouts below are examples from my work in _Earth 408: Intro to GIS for Earth Science_. These projects were assigned and sourced from the textbook _Discovering GIS and ArcGIS Pro_ (Third Edition) by Bradley Shellito. 
<br />
<br />

### #4- Suitability Analysis (Raster): 
<br />
In this assignment I employed ArcGIS Model Builder and Python script to analyze and edit multiple raster datasets at once using various raster calculations, ultimately outputting a dataset that displayed areas with the correct limiting criteria. 
<br />

### #5- Watershed Analysis: 
<br />
Here I used a digital elevation model to calculate the watershed boundary, flow direction, and  stream order of the study area, using ArcGIS Hydrologic Modeling tools.
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />


### #6- Cost Path Analysis: 
<br />
This project shows the local 3D scene of a shaded relief of terrain. I calculated distance over a digital elevation model, and learned how the "cost" of a path is calculated and changed given different input parameters.
<br />
<br />

<br />

My **final project** for this course was a case study of Harmful Algal Bloom formation in a local lake, in which I conducted a watershed analysis via ArcGIS. My research poster can be viewed <a href="./assets/final_proj/final.pdf">here</a>.

### QGIS Layouts
These layouts are projects I've done for fun, to practice using QGIS and explore cartographic design skills.
<br /><br />
The bathymetry layouts are an ongoing project of mine, I really find bathymetry data to be so visually interesting to display in a GIS! I've used these to test out variations in color palette and style. 
<br /><br />
In the Mumbai layout, I aimed to stylistically display the area's elevation.
<br /><br />
The bottom layout is a map of the venues of my current campus job at the UMS Ticket Office, which I love!
