## Google Maps Styles

### People's Square
In this exercise, I used the [Google Maps Platform Styling Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/) to create my own Google Maps basemap, which I've named People's Square. To create the style, I first searched Google for an image (filtered by "marked for resuse" license) whose color scheme matched that of the map style I wanted to create. 

I ultimately settled on the following image of People's Square in Shanghai (photo by [f11photo](https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/201898682/f11photo?load_type=author&prev_url=detail) via [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/), standard license):

</p>

I then used [Canva's color palette generator](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to create a custom color palette based on the image I had chosen.

</p>

Back in the Google Maps Styling Wizard, I selected the "Dark" theme to serve as my base template and then proceeded to change the colors of various features using the hex codes from my custom color palette. A screenshot of the final product is displayed below. To access an interactive version of the map style, just click [here](https://jaxgoodlabs.github.io/GIS_portfolio/peoples-square.html).

### Night Glacier 2
The Night Glacier 2 style was inspired by this image of ice climbers exploring a glacier at night, which I again used Canva to convert into a custom color palette.

</p>

The resulting map style is presented below.
